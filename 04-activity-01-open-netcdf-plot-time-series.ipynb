There are 20 options for models, and to pick one you can assign `model = ` to any number between 0 and 19, where 0 is the first option in the list, and 19 is the last. \n",

    "`var = ` is the variable in the dataset you want to be analyzed. You can see the variables in the cell two below this one. The variables are listed after `var_long_name = `. The variables are as described by the variable name, so `air_temperature` is the aggregate air temperature for each month, for example. There are 9 options for variables, and to pick one you can assign `var = ` to any number between 0 and 8, where 0 is the first option in the list, and 8 is the last. \n",

    "Lastly, `scenario = ` can be chosen to pick which climate scenario you want to pull your data from. `0` is the historical data and doesn't include any modeling. `1` is the `rcp45` scenario, which is described as an intermediate climate scenario. `2` is the `rcp85` scenario, which is a worst case climate scenario.
